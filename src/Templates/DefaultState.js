  content: `Happy Easter! And happy birthday to us! 2 years ago, we launched the Darkglass Ultra plugin. Since then we've launched a further 7 plugins. We've got plenty more on our roadmap (s o o n), and we can't wait to show you the Quad Cortex later this year! We'd love to throw a big party, but since nobody can go outside, we're just going to discount all our plugins instead! Get 30% off all plugins until April 18th 00:00 EEST.`,
